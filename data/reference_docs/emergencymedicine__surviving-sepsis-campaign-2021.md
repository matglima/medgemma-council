Sepsis Campaign Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2021 PUBLISHED: 10/03/2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2021 Citation: Evans L, Rhodes A, Alhazzani W, et al. Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021. Crit Care Med. 2021 Nov;49(11):e1063-e1143. Jump to Recommendations International Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2021 Updated global adult sepsis guidelines, released in October 2021 by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC), place an increased emphasis on improving the care of sepsis patients after they are discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU) and represent greater geographic and gender diversity than previous versions. The new guidelines specifically address the challenges of treating patients experiencing the long-term effects of sepsis. Patients often experience lengthy ICU stays and then face a long, complicated road to recovery. In addition to physical rehabilitation challenges, patients and their families are often uncertain how to coordinate care that promotes recovery and matches their goals of care. To address these issues, the guidelines recommend involving patients and their families in goals-of-care discussions and hospital discharge plans, which should include early and ongoing follow-up with clinicians to support and manage long-term effects and assessment of physical, cognitive, and emotional issues after discharge.

Quality of evidence: Moderate for screening and very low for standard operating procedures. Strong Screening Performance Improvement We recommend against using qSOFA compared with SIRS, NEWS, or MEWS as a single screening tool for sepsis or septic shock. Quality of evidence: Moderate Strong Screening Screening Tools For adults suspected of having sepsis, we suggest measuring blood lactate. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Screening Blood Lactate Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately. Best Practice Initial Resuscitation Treatment & Resuscitation (if time fits please use) For patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Initial Resuscitation Fluid Resuscitation For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone. Quality of evidence: Very low Remarks Dynamic parameters include response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus, using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography, where available. Weak Initial Resuscitation Fluid Resuscitation For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest guiding resuscitation to decrease serum lactate in patients with elevated lactate levels over not using serum lactate. Quality of evidence: Low Remarks During acute resuscitation, serum lactate level should be interpreted considering the clinical context and other causes of elevated lactate. Weak Initial Resuscitation Serum Lactate For adults with septic shock, we suggest using capillary refill time to guide resuscitation as an adjunct to other measures of perfusion. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Initial Resuscitation Perfusion For adults with septic shock on vasopressors, we recommend an initial target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg over higher MAP targets. Quality of evidence: Moderate Strong Mean Arterial Pressure Perfusion For adults with sepsis or septic shock who require ICU admission, we suggest admitting the patients to the ICU within 6 hours. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Admission to ICU ICU Admission For adults with suspected sepsis or septic shock but unconfirmed infection, we recommend continuously reevaluating and searching for alternative diagnoses and discontinuing empiric antimicrobials if an alternative cause of illness is demonstrated or strongly suspected. Best Practice Infection Dx Infection For adults with possible septic shock or a high likelihood for sepsis, we recommend administering antimicrobials immediately, ideally within 1 hour of recognition. Quality of evidence: Low Strong Infection Time to Antimicrobials For adults with possible sepsis without shock, we recommend rapid assessment of the likelihood of infectious versus noninfectious causes of acute illness. Remarks Rapid assessment includes history and clinical examination, tests for both infectious and noninfectious causes of acute illness and immediate treatment for acute conditions that can mimic sepsis. Whenever possible this should be completed within 3 hours of presentation so that a decision can be made as to the likelihood of an infectious cause of the patient’s presentation and timely antimicrobial therapy provided if the likelihood of sepsis is thought to be high. Best Practice Infection Time to Antimicrobials For adults with possible sepsis without shock, we suggest a time-limited course of rapid investigation and if concern for infection persists, the administration of antimicrobials within 3 hours from the time when sepsis was first recognized. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Infection Time to Antimicrobials For adults with a low likelihood of infection and without shock, we suggest deferring antimicrobials while continuing to closely monitoring the patient. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Infection Time to Antimicrobials For adults with suspected sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using procalcitonin plus clinical evaluation to decide when to start antimicrobials, as compared to clinical evaluation alone. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Infection Procalcitonin For adults with sepsis or septic shock at high risk of MRSA, we recommend using empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage over using antimicrobials without MRSA coverage. Best Practice Infection MRSA Coverage For adults with sepsis or septic shock at low risk of MRSA, we suggest against using empiric antimicrobials with MRSA coverage, as compared with using antimicrobials without MRSA coverage. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Infection MRSA Coverage For adults with sepsis or septic shock and low risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, we suggest against using 2 gram-negative agents for empiric treatment, as compared to 1 gram-negative agent. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Infection Multidrug Resistant Organisms For adults with sepsis or septic shock and high risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, we suggest using 2 antimicrobials with gram-negative coverage for empiric treatment over 1 gram-negative agent. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Infection Multidrug Resistant Organisms For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using double gram-negative coverage once the causative pathogen and the susceptibilities are known. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Infection Double gram-negative coverage For adults with sepsis or septic shock at high risk of fungal infection, we suggest using empiric antifungal therapy over no antifungal therapy. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Infection Anti-fungal Therapy For adults with sepsis or septic shock at low risk of fungal infection, we suggest against empiric use of antifungal therapy. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Infection Anti-fungal Therapy We make no recommendation on the use of antiviral agents. No Recommendation Infection Antiviral Therapy For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using prolonged infusion of beta-lactams for maintenance (after an initial bolus) over conventional bolus infusion. Quality of evidence: Moderate Weak Infection Blood Lactate For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend optimizing dosing strategies of antimicrobials based on accepted pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles and specific drug properties. Best Practice Infection Optomizing Antimicrobials For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend prompt removal of intravascular access devices that are a possible source of sepsis or septic shock after other vascular access has been established. Best Practice Infection Source Control For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest daily assessment for de-escalation of antimicrobials over using fixed durations of therapy without daily reassessment for de-escalation. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Infection De-escalation of Antibiotics For adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, we suggest using shorter over longer duration of antimicrobial therapy. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Infection Duration of Antibiotics For adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control where optimal duration of therapy is unclear, we suggest using procalcitonin AND clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antimicrobials over clinical evaluation alone. ​Quality of evidence: Low Weak Infection Procalcitonin For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend using crystalloids as first-line fluid for resuscitation. Quality of evidence: Moderate Strong Hemodynamic Management Fluid Resuscitation For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using balanced crystalloids instead of normal saline for resuscitation. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Hemodynamic Management Fluid Resuscitation For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using albumin in patients who received large volumes of crystalloids. Quality of evidence: Moderate Weak Hemodynamic Management Fluid Resuscitation For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend against using starches for resuscitation. Quality of evidence: High Strong Hemodynamic Management Fluid Resuscitation For adults with sepsis and septic shock, we suggest against using gelatin for resuscitation. Quality of evidence: Moderate Weak Hemodynamic Management Blood Loss Reduction For adults with septic shock, we recommend using norepinephrine as the first-line agent over other vasopressors. Quality of evidence: Dopamine: High Vasopressin: Moderate Epinephrine: Low Selepressin: Low Angiotensin 2: Very low Remarks In settings where norepinephrine is not available, epinephrine or dopamine can be used as an alternative, but we encourage efforts to improve the availability of norepinephrine. Special attention should be given to patients at risk for arrhythmias when using dopamine and epinephrine. Strong Hemodynamic Management Vasoactive Agents For adults with septic shock on norepinephrine with inadequate mean arterial pressure levels, we suggest adding vasopressin instead of escalating the dose of norepinephrine. Quality of evidence: Moderate Remarks In our practice, vasopressin is usually started when the dose of norepinephrine is in the range of 0.25−0.5 μg/kg/min. Weak Hemodynamic Management Vasoactive Agents For adults with septic shock and inadequate mean arterial pressure levels despite norepinephrine and vasopressin, we suggest adding epinephrine. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Hemodynamic Management Vasoactive Agents For adults with septic shock, we suggest against using terlipressin. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Hemodynamic Management Vasoactive Agents For adults with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction with persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume status and arterial blood pressure, we suggest either adding dobutamine to norepinephrine or using epinephrine alone. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Hemodynamic Management Inotropes For adults with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction with persistent hypoperfusion despite adequate volume status and arterial blood pressure, we suggest against using levosimendan. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Hemodynamic Management Inotropes For adults with septic shock, we suggest invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure over noninvasive monitoring, as soon as practical and if resources are available. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Hemodynamic Management Invasive Monitoring Monitoring & IV Access For adults with septic shock, we suggest starting vasopressors peripherally to restore mean arterial pressure rather than delaying initiation until central venous access is secured. Quality of evidence: Very low Remarks When using vasopressors peripherally, they should be administered only for a short period of time and in a vein in or proximal to the antecubital fossa. Weak Hemodynamic Management Monitoring & IV Access There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of restrictive versus liberal fluid strategies in the first 24 hours of resuscitation in patients with sepsis and septic shock who still have signs of hypoperfusion and volume depletion after the initial resuscitation. Remarks Fluid resuscitation should be given only if patients present with signs of hypoperfusion. No Recommendation Hemodynamic Management Fluid Resuscitation There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of conservative oxygen targets in adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure. No Recommendation Ventilation O2 Targets For adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure, we suggest the use of high-flow nasal oxygen over noninvasive ventilation. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Ventilation High-Flow Nasal O2 There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of noninvasive ventilation compared to invasive ventilation for adults with sepsis-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure. No Recommendation Ventilation Noninvasive Ventilation For adults with sepsis-induced ARDS, we recommend using a low tidal volume ventilation strategy (6 mL/kg), over a high tidal volume strategy (> 10 mL/kg). Quality of evidence: High Strong Ventilation Protective Ventilation ARDS For adults with sepsis-induced severe ARDS, we recommend using an upper limit goal for plateau pressures of 30 cm H2O, over higher plateau pressures. Quality of evidence: Moderate Strong Ventilation Protective Ventilation ARDS For adults with moderate to severe sepsis-induced ARDS, we suggest using higher PEEP over lower PEEP. Quality of evidence: Moderate Weak Ventilation Protective Ventilation ARDS For adults with sepsis-induced respiratory failure (without ARDS), we suggest using low tidal volume as compared with high tidal volume ventilation. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Ventilation Low TV ARDS For adults with sepsis-induced severe ARDS, we suggest using traditional recruitment maneuvers. Quality of evidence: Moderate Weak Ventilation Recruitment Maneuvers When using recruitment maneuvers, we recommend against using incremental PEEP titration/strategy. Quality of evidence: Moderate Strong Ventilation Recruitment Maneuvers For adults with sepsis-induced moderate-severe ARDS, we recommend using prone ventilation for greater than 12 hours daily. Quality of evidence: Moderate Strong Ventilation Prone Ventilation For adults with sepsis-induced moderate to severe ARDS, we suggest using intermittent NMBA boluses over NMBA continuous infusion. Quality of evidence: Moderate Weak Ventilation Neuro Muscular Blockade For adults with sepsis-induced severe ARDS, we suggest using venovenous ECMO when conventional mechanical ventilation fails in experienced centers with the infrastructure in place to support its use. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Ventilation ECMO For adults with septic shock and an ongoing requirement for vasopressor therapy, we suggest using IV corticosteroids. Quality of evidence: Moderate Remarks The typical corticosteroid used in adults with septic shock is IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg/d given as 50 mg intravenously every 6 hours or as a continuous infusion. It is suggested that this is commenced at a dose of norepinephrine or epinephrine ≥ 0.25 mcg/kg/min at least 4 hours after initiation. Weak Additional Therapies Corticosteroids For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using polymyxin B hemoperfusion. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Additional Therapies Blood Purification Polymyxin B Hemoperfusion There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of other blood purification techniques. No Recommendation Additional Therapies Transfusion For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend using a restrictive transfusion strategy over a liberal transfusion strategy. Quality of evidence: Moderate Remarks A restrictive transfusion strategy typically includes a hemoglobin concentration transfusion trigger of 70 g/L; however, RBC transfusion should not be guided by hemoglobin concentration alone. Assessment of a patient’s overall clinical status and consideration of extenuating circumstances such as acute myocardial ischemia, severe hypoxemia, or acute hemorrhage is required. Strong Additional Therapies Transfusion For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using IV immunoglobulin. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Additional Therapies Immunoglobulins For adults with sepsis or septic shock and risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding, we suggest using stress ulcer prophylaxis. Quality of evidence: Moderate Weak Additional Therapies SUP For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend using pharmacologic venous thromboembolism prophylaxis unless a contraindication to such therapy exists. Quality of evidence: Moderate Strong Additional Therapies VTE For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend using low-molecular-weight heparin over unfractionated heparin for VTE prophylaxis. Quality of evidence: Moderate Strong Additional Therapies VTE For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using mechanical venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in addition to pharmacologic prophylaxis, over pharmacologic prophylaxis alone. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Additional Therapies VTE In adults with sepsis or septic shock and acute kidney injury, we suggest using either continuous or intermittent renal replacement therapy. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Additional Therapies Renal Replacement In adults with sepsis or septic shock and acute kidney injury with no definitive indications for renal replacement therapy, we suggest against using renal replacement therapy. Quality of evidence: Moderate Weak Additional Therapies Renal Replacement For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend initiating insulin therapy at a glucose level of ≥ 180mg/dL (10mmol/L). Quality of evidence: Moderate Remarks Following initiation of an insulin therapy, a typical target blood glucose range is 144-180 mg/dL (8-10 mmol/L). Strong Additional Therapies Glucose Control For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against using IV vitamin C. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Additional Therapies Vitamin C For adults with septic shock and hypoperfusion-induced lactic acidemia, we suggest against using sodium bicarbonate therapy to improve hemodynamics or to reduce vasopressor requirements. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Additional Therapies Bicarbonate Therapy For adults with septic shock and severe metabolic acidemia (pH ≤ 7.2) and acute kidney injury (AKIN score 2 or 3), we suggest using sodium bicarbonate therapy. Quality of evidence: Low Weak Additional Therapies Bicarbonate Therapy For adult patients with sepsis or septic shock who can be fed enterally, we suggest early (within 72 hours) initiation of enteral nutrition. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak Additional Therapies Nutrition For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend discussing goals of care and prognosis with patients and families over no such discussion. Best Practice LTO-GOC Goals of Care For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest addressing goals of care early (within 72 hours) over late (72 hours or later). Quality of evidence: Low Weak LTO-GOC Goals of Care For adults with sepsis or septic shock, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on any specific standardized criterion to trigger a goals-of-care discussion. No Recommendation LTO-GOC Goals of Care For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we recommend that the principles of palliative care (which may include palliative care consultation based on clinician judgement) be integrated into the treatment plan, when appropriate, to address patient and family symptoms and suffering. Best Practice LTO-GOC Palliative Care For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest against routine formal palliative care consultation for all patients over palliative care consultation based on clinician judgement. Quality of evidence: Low Weak LTO-GOC Palliative Care For adult survivors of sepsis or septic shock and their families, we suggest referral to peer support groups over no such referral. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak LTO-GOC Peer Support Groups For adults with sepsis or septic shock, we suggest using a handoff process of critically important information at transitions of care over no such handoff process. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak LTO-GOC Transitions of Care For adults with sepsis or septic shock, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of any specific structured handoff tool over usual handoff processes. No Recommendation LTO-GOC Transitions of Care For adults with sepsis or septic shock and their families, we recommend screening for economic and social support (including housing, nutritional, financial, and spiritual support), and making referrals where available to meet these needs. Best Practice LTO-GOC Economic Social Support Transitions of Care For adults with sepsis or septic shock and their families, we suggest offering written and verbal sepsis education (diagnosis, treatment, and post-ICU/post-sepsis syndrome) prior to hospital discharge and in the follow-up setting. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak LTO-GOC Education PT & Families For adults with sepsis or septic shock and their families, we recommend that the clinical team provide the opportunity to participate in shared decision-making in post-ICU and hospital discharge planning to ensure that discharge plans are acceptable and feasible. Best Practice LTO-GOC Shared Decision Making For adults with sepsis and septic shock and their families, we suggest using a critical care transition program, compared with usual care, on transfer to the ward. Quality of evidence: Very low Weak LTO-GOC Discharge Planning For adults with sepsis and septic shock, we recommend reconciling medications at both ICU and hospital discharge. Best Practice LTO-GOC Discharge Planning For adult survivors of sepsis and septic shock and their families, we recommend including information about the ICU stay, sepsis and related diagnoses, treatments, and common impairments after sepsis in the written and verbal hospital discharge summary. Best Practice LTO-GOC Discharge Planning For adults with sepsis or septic shock who developed new impairments, we recommend hospital discharge plans include follow-up with clinicians able to support and manage new and long-term sequelae. Best Practice LTO-GOC Discharge Planning For adults with sepsis or septic shock and their families, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on early post-hospital discharge follow-up compared with routine post-hospital discharge follow-up. No Recommendation LTO-GOC Discharge Planning For adults with sepsis or septic shock, there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against early cognitive therapy. No Recommendation LTO-GOC Cognitive Therapy For adult survivors of sepsis or septic shock, we recommend assessment and follow-up for physical, cognitive, and emotional problems after hospital discharge. Best Practice LTO-GOC Post Discharge Follow-up For adult survivors of sepsis or septic shock, we suggest referral to a post-critical illness follow-up program if available. Weak LTO-GOC Post Discharge Follow-up For adult survivors of sepsis or septic shock receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours or an ICU stay of more than 72 hours, we suggest referral to a post-hospital rehabilitation program.
